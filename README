Independent Study
=================

This repository contains the materials for my high school independent study
course on programming language compilers. 

The goal is to write a basic compiler for a basic, unnamed language.

Components
==========

The following components have been / are being implemented:

    automata [w] :  implementation of nondeterminstic and deterministic finite
                    automata
    lalr     [p] :  generation of SLR(1), LR(1), and LALR(1) parse tables from
                    context-free grammars
    lalrgen  [p] :  parser generator as a procedural macro
    llex     [w] :  lexical analyzer generator as a procedural macro
    memalloc [b] :  malloc/free implementation attempt as a dynamic lib
    pratt    [w] :  attempt at a basic Pratt expression parser
    regexp   [w] :  implementation of limited regular expressions
    regexp2  [w] :  better implementation of regular expressions with support
                    for character classes and other operators

See subdirectories for more information and examples.

[w]: Generall working
[p]: Partially working
[b]: Broken / never worked

Building
========

Rust is required to build the above components.  See `Makefile` for other
targets and requirements.
