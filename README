Independent Study
=================

This repository contains the materials for my high school independent study
course on programming language compilers. 

The goal is to write a basic compiler for a basic, unnamed language.

Components
==========

The following components have been / are being implemented:

    automata :  implementation of nondeterminstic and deterministic finite
                automata
    lalr     :  generation of SLR(1), LR(1), and LALR(1) parse tables from
                context-free grammars
    lalrgen  :  parser generator as a procedural macro
    llex     :  lexical analyzer generator as a procedural macro
    regexp   :  implementation of limited regular expressions
    regexp2  :  better implementation of regular expressions with support for
                character classes and other operators

See subdirectories for more information and examples.

Building
========

Rust is required to build the above components.  See `Makefile` for other
targets and requirements.
