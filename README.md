# Independent Study on Compilers

This repository contains the materials for my independent study course
on compilers in my senior year of high school. The goal is to write a
basic compiler for a basic, unnamed language.

## Building

The following dependencies are required to be present to build this
project:

-   `rust`
-   `cargo`

These dependencies are required to build the "book":

-   `R` and `Rscript`
-   `rmarkdown` R package
-   `pandoc`
